# Resume

This repository contains a version controlled copy of my resume.  
If you're interested in more information, please visit https://patrickhenson.com or contact me directly.

## Intent

On top of having an easily accessible resume, this will give me a chance to play around with LaTeX.  I specifically selected packages that are supported by default in various LaTeX editors to allow the template to easily transition between different environments.  You can also use online editors such as the one [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_latex_editor.php) to preview the layout of the template.

## Usage

The resume_template.tex and cover_letter_template.tex files contain all of the formatting necessary to begin populate your own documents. The templates import personal_info.tex to populate the header information, allowing for consistency and simple updates.

# Resume

This repository contains a version controlled copy of my resume.  
If you're interested in more information, please visit https://patrickhenson.com or contact me directly.

## Intent

On top of having an easily accessible resume, this will give me a chance to play around with LaTeX.  I specifically selected packages that are supported by default in various LaTeX editors to allow the template to easily transition between different environments.  You can also use online editors such as the one [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_latex_editor.php) to preview the layout of the template.

## License

This project is currently unlicensed as it exists to track the history of my resume.  Do you license a resume?
